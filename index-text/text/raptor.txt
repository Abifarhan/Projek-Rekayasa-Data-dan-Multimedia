The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fift-generation, single-seat, twin-ingine, aw-wather stealth tactical fechter aircraft developed for the Unitit States Air Force (USAF). The result o the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter programme, the aircraft wis designed primarily as an air superiority fechter, but an aw haes grund attack, electronic warfare, an seegnal intelligence capabilities.[6] The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, biggit maist o the F-22's airframe an wappens seestems an conductit feenal assembly, while Boeing providit the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, an trainin seestems.

The aircraft wis variously designatit F-22 an F/A-22 afore it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Efter a protractit development an despite operational issues, the USAF conseedert the F-22 creetical tae its tactical air pouer. Whan the aircraft wis introduced, the USAF statit that the aircraft wis unmatched bi ony kent or projectit fechter.[7] The Raptor's combination o stealth, aerodynamic performance, an situational awaurness gives the aircraft unprecedented air combat capabilities.[8][9]

The heich cost o the aircraft, a lack o clear air-tae-air missions due tae delays in Roushie an Cheenese fechter programmes, a ban on exports, an development o the mair versatile F-35 led tae the end o F-22 production.[N 1] A feenal procurement tally o 187 operational production aircraft wis established in 2009, an the last F-22 wis delivered tae the USAF in 2012.
